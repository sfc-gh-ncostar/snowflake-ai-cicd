# Snowflake Cortex Agent Development Rules

## Core Development Philosophy
- Follow Snowflake best practices for enterprise-grade agent development
- Design for trust, consistency, and reliability
- Treat agent development as product development

## Workflow Guidance
When generating Cortex Agent configurations, follow the structured workflow:
1. **Agent Description**: Clear, user-focused descriptions (50-100 words)
2. **Tool Descriptions**: WHAT each tool does - capabilities and data content
3. **Orchestration Instructions**: WHEN to use each tool - decision logic and Multi-tool coordination 
4. **Response Instructions**: Professional formatting and communication standards
5. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation approach

## Key Principles
- **Business Context**: Integrate domain-specific knowledge and terminology
- **Edge Case Handling**: Provide robust fallback strategies
- **Response Quality**: Lead with answers, cite sources, acknowledge limitations
- **Production Ready**: Generate enterprise-grade configurations

## Tool Integration
- **Cortex Analyst**: Structured data analysis with semantic models
- **Cortex Search**: Unstructured data and document retrieval
- **Custom Tools**: Business logic via stored procedures/UDFs

## Quality Standards
- Generate specific, actionable content (not generic guidelines)
- Include concrete examples and step-by-step instructions
- Handle edge cases with specific fallback strategies
- Focus on business context and domain-specific logic
- Avoid verbose explanations - be crisp and clear
